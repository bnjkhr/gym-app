# Test Infrastructure Status

**Datum:** 19. Oktober 2025
**Session:** Test Coverage Initiative - Day 1
**Status:** Infrastructure Complete, Tests Pending

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Today

### 1. Documentation
- **TEST_COVERAGE_PLAN.md** - Comprehensive 3-phase test strategy
  - Target: 60-70% coverage
  - Estimated: 18-23 hours total
  - Prioritized by criticality

### 2. Test Infrastructure Files Created

#### TestHelpers.swift ‚úÖ
- Test fixtures for Exercise, Workout
- Assertion helpers (XCTAssertApproximatelyEqual, XCTAssertNotNilAndUnwrap)
- Simplified, working version

#### MockModelContext.swift ‚úÖ
- In-memory ModelContext factory for tests
- Prevents disk persistence during testing
- XCTestCase extensions for easy setup

#### WorkoutDataServiceTests.swift (Stub) ‚è≥
- File created with placeholder test
- Needs to be implemented with correct API signatures
- Service methods discovered:
  - `allWorkouts()` not `workouts()`
  - `exercise(named:)` not `exerciseByName()`
  - `deleteExercises(at:)` not `deleteExercise(withId:)`

### 3. Fixed Issues
- Fixed old test parameter order (Workout init)
  - `RestTimerPersistenceTests.swift` - date before exercises ‚úÖ
  - `RestTimerStateManagerTests.swift` - date before exercises ‚úÖ

---

## ‚ùå Blocking Issues

### Old Tests Are Broken
The existing RestTimer tests (`RestTimerPersistenceTests.swift`, `RestTimerStateManagerTests.swift`) have compilation errors due to API changes:

**Errors:**
1. `timerEngine` is now `private` - tests can't access it
2. `exerciseIndex` is now `let` constant - can't be modified
3. Optional Int parameters need unwrapping
4. RestTimerState API has changed

**Root Cause:** The RestTimer system was refactored but tests weren't updated.

**Impact:** Cannot run ANY tests until these are fixed.

---

## üîß Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Blocking)
1. **Fix RestTimerPersistenceTests.swift**
   - Update `timerEngine` access (make internal or use public API)
   - Fix Optional Int conversions
   - Fix exerciseIndex mutation

2. **Fix RestTimerStateManagerTests.swift**
   - Same issues as above
   - Update to match current RestTimerStateManager API

### After Tests Run
3. **Implement WorkoutDataServiceTests**
   - Match actual WorkoutDataService API
   - Write 15-20 tests for CRUD operations
   - Test edge cases (nil context, empty database)

4. **Write ProfileServiceTests**
   - Profile CRUD
   - Onboarding flow
   - Default profile creation

5. **Write WorkoutSessionServiceTests**
   - Session recording
   - Session history
   - Session deletion

---

## üìä Current Coverage

**Estimated:** <5% (only placeholder tests)

**Target after Phase 1:** 25-30%

**Components with Tests:**
- ‚ùå WorkoutDataService - 0%
- ‚ùå ProfileService - 0%
- ‚ùå WorkoutAnalyticsService - 0%
- ‚ùå WorkoutSessionService - 0%
- ‚ö†Ô∏è RestTimer System - Tests exist but broken

## üéØ Session Goals vs. Actual

| Goal | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Create test plan | ‚úÖ Done | Comprehensive 3-phase plan |
| Set up test infrastructure | ‚úÖ Done | Helpers, Mocks created |
| Write WorkoutDataService tests | ‚è≥ Partial | Stub created, needs implementation |
| Run tests successfully | ‚ùå Blocked | Old tests broken |
| Measure initial coverage | ‚ùå Blocked | Can't run tests yet |

## üí° Lessons Learned

1. **API Discovery is Critical**
   - Should have checked actual service APIs before writing tests
   - Assumed API names, but they were different

2. **Legacy Tests Need Maintenance**
   - Old tests break when code evolves
   - Should have been updated during refactoring

3. **Test-First Would Help**
   - Writing tests first would have caught API changes
   - Would enforce stable APIs

4. **In-Memory Testing Works Well**
   - SwiftData's `isStoredInMemoryOnly` is perfect for tests
   - Fast, isolated, no cleanup needed

## üöÄ Tomorrow's Plan

1. **Morning (1-2h):** Fix old RestTimer tests
   - Make timerEngine internal/public
   - Fix Optional handling
   - Update API calls

2. **Afternoon (2-3h):** Write Service tests
   - WorkoutDataServiceTests (15-20 tests)
   - ProfileServiceTests (10 tests)

3. **Evening (1h):** Run & measure
   - Run all tests
   - Generate coverage report
   - Update TEST_COVERAGE_PLAN.md with results

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours to Phase 1 completion
