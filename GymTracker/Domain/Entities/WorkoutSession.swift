/// Domain Entity representing an active or completed workout session
///
/// This is a pure Swift struct with no framework dependencies. It represents
/// the core business logic of a workout session in the Domain layer.
///
/// **Design Decisions:**
/// - `struct` instead of `class` - Value semantics, immutability by default
/// - All properties have explicit types - No optionals unless truly optional
/// - Computed properties for derived data - No stored state duplication
/// - Equatable & Identifiable for SwiftUI/Testing - But no SwiftData dependencies
///
/// **Usage:**
/// ```swift
/// let session = WorkoutSession(
///     id: UUID(),
///     workoutId: workout.id,
///     startDate: Date(),
///     exercises: []
/// )
/// ```
